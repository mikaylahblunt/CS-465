# Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

When developing the full stack project, there were a few types of frontend used. Express HTML was used, Angular was then used to create the SPA portion, which included the Admin login/register functions. The backend used MongoDB, a NoSQL database and Node.js because of how easy it was to modify the schema. 


# Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON cannot contain functions. JavaScript objects can contain functions. JSON can be created and used by other programming languages. JavaScript objects can only be used in JavaScript. JSON was a bridge between frontend and backend. 

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

An instance that code was refactored to improve functionality would be the trip-card, the rendering of a single trip in a card-style view has been refactored into a
separate Angular component that can now be used anywhere in the application.

# Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security.

Methods for request and retrieval would include the different methods, such as GET POST PUT and DELETE. This has specific endpoints and how we interact with the servers. Adding in security, adds user permissions and testing this on a site like postman would be best, to see error codes and how the website is properly working. 


Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

An API endpoint is a digital location where an API receives requests about a specific resource on its server. Methods would include GET POST PUT and DELETE, and security is another layed that is used to prevent unauthorized users from accessing a database. 


# Reflection

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course helped me learn the front and back end in development which is essential. It helped me reach professional goals by learning how to work through problem solving, which is always essential. I am a master at the terminal, which seems to be not needed but the terminal commands are essential when it comes to downloaded needed software, pushing GIT and much more! I also learned more about Express and Node, I had used Mongo in past classes, so learning about this again in another application was refreshing.
